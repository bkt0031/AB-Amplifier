# Class AB Monaural 2 Watt Amplifier

With regards to class AB audio amplifiers there is really nothing new under the sun, and this design is no exception.

I have a collection of amateur radio transceivers I built as kits from QRP Labs that the audio ouput can only drive small
headphones (earbuds). Personally I cannot stand having earbuds in my ears for long durations, so I wanted to make an
audio amplifier to drive a speaker I reprovisioned from a commercial mobile radio. 

My requirements for the audio amplifier was:

* Run off of a 12 VDC, single rail, power supply
* Drive a 4 Ohm speaker
* Loud enough for a typical size room with enough volume to overcome any incidental noise/sounds
* Power switch
* Power input on a 2.1x5.5 mm panel jack
* Power indicator
* Volume control
